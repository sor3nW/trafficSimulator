     * Each road can be stored in a `RoadData` struct (see `road.h`).
     *
     * You'll want to store all of these `RoadData` structs in a single array.  This is important to track the order that
     * roads were added to your graph.  These are also the order they are processed in each time step.  You can store this
     * array in your TrafficData struct.
     *
     * You'll add edges to a graph to represent each road using `setEdge` (see `graph.c`).  The vertices of the graph
     * represent intersections.  The graph will do the work of finding shortest paths (see `getNextOnShortestPath` in graph.c
     * and the longest shortest path problem on Blackboard).
     *
     * It will also help to add your `RoadData` structs to your graph using `setEdgeData` (see `graph.c`).   You can then
     * retrieve that `RoadData` struct by calling `getEdgeData`.  This will be helpful for finding roads when cars pass
     * through intersections.
     *
     * Each event will be stored in an Event struct (see `event.h`).
     *
     * It's recommended to store all of the `Event` structs in a single priority queue (using time step as the priority).  This
     * allows you to quickly find the next event to execute by time step (see `enqueueByPriority`, `getFrontPriority`, and
     * `dequeuePQ`).
     *
     * Each car is stored in a Car struct (see `car.h`).
